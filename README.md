# Simplex-Algorithm-Linear-Program-Solver
The code is used to solve linear programs using the simplex algorithm. It allows the users to provide the input objective function and constraints according to their requirements, then provides the optimized objective function value.
The code is available in 'Final Simplex Algorithm Glt.py'
